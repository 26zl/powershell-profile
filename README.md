# PowerShellPerfect

[![CI](https://github.com/26zl/PowerShellPerfect/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/26zl/PowerShellPerfect/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A PowerShell profile made to make a CLI nerd's life easier. Brings the Linux terminal experience to Windows - grep, cat, ls with icons, fuzzy search, zoxide, and 60+ utility commands out of the box. One command installs everything and keeps it updated. Works on both PowerShell 5.1 and 7+.

**Why use this?**

- **One command, fully configured** - installs 6 tools, Nerd Fonts, Oh My Posh theme, and Windows Terminal settings in one run
- **Self-updating** - profile, theme, and terminal config sync from upstream with hash verification
- **AI/CI sandbox safe** - detects non-interactive environments and suppresses network calls and UI setup automatically
- **PS5 + PS7** - installs to both profile directories and handles every API difference between editions
- **Hardened** - sensitive commands filtered from PSReadLine history; no secrets in source
- **Fast startup** - init scripts cached to disk
- **Survives updates** - personal overrides in `profile_user.ps1` and `user-settings.json` are never touched

Originally forked and inspired by [ChrisTitusTech/powershell-profile](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/powershell-profile).

## Install

Run in an **elevated** PowerShell window:

```powershell
irm "https://github.com/26zl/PowerShellPerfect/raw/main/setup.ps1" | iex
```

Restart your terminal after running. For the best experience use [PowerShell 7](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell).

### Manual Setup

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/26zl/PowerShellPerfect.git
cd PowerShellPerfect
.\setup.ps1
.\setprofile.ps1
```

When running locally you can override terminal defaults (not available via `irm | iex`):

```powershell
.\setup.ps1 -Opacity 85 -ColorScheme "One Half Dark" -FontSize 12
```

> **Controlled Folder Access:** If Windows Defender blocks the setup, allow PowerShell through:
>
> ```powershell
> Add-MpPreference -ControlledFolderAccessAllowedApplications "C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe"
> Add-MpPreference -ControlledFolderAccessAllowedApplications "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe"
> ```

## Updates

```powershell
Update-Profile      # Sync profile, theme, caches, and Windows Terminal settings
Update-PowerShell   # Check for new PowerShell 7 releases
Update-Tools        # Update all managed tools (Oh My Posh, eza, zoxide, fzf, bat, ripgrep)
```

`Update-Profile` requires hash verification by default. Confirm with `-ExpectedSha256 '<hash>'`, or use `-SkipHashCheck` to bypass. Use `-Force` to re-apply settings even when nothing changed upstream.

## Uninstall

Remove the profile, caches, and Windows Terminal changes:

```powershell
Uninstall-Profile              # Core cleanup: profile files, caches, WT restore, PSFzf
Uninstall-Profile -RemoveTools # Also uninstall managed CLI tools (Oh My Posh, eza, etc.)
Uninstall-Profile -All         # Remove everything including tools, fonts, and user data
```

Optional switches: `-RemoveTools` (winget packages), `-RemoveUserData` (profile_user.ps1, user-settings.json), `-RemoveFonts` (Nerd Fonts, requires admin), `-All` (everything). Supports `-WhatIf` to preview without making changes.

## Customization

Two files survive updates and override everything:

- **`profile_user.ps1`** (`Split-Path $PROFILE`) - PowerShell overrides: aliases, functions, editor, colors, modules
- **`user-settings.json`** (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\PowerShellProfile\`) - Terminal overrides: theme, opacity, font, keybindings

Both are created automatically during setup. `profile_user.ps1` is dot-sourced last so your settings always win.
